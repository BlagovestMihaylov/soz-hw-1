# Implementation for the Genetic Algorithm in solving the N-Queens problem.

## Classes include:

### Chromosome.java - class which contains the solutions.
### GeneticAlgorithm.java - class which implements the genetic algorithm for N-Queens. Algorithm parameters are defined here.
### Writer.java - class which holds a string list to be written in a log file.
### TestRunner.java - class which runs the tests and invokes the creation of the log file.

## How to use:

### Install JAVA JDK.
### Compile and run TestRunner.java along with its required classes in your preferred editor.
